# Python
I have done a few applications with Python, and feel very comfortable working with the program language
- Check out my previous application I built here --> [Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/schlangens/TT_P1_NumberGuessingGame/blob/main/guessing_game.py)
- Currently working on [Basketball Team Stat App](https://github.com/schlangens/basketball_stats_tool/blob/main/application.py)
